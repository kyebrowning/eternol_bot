# ETERNØL BOT
Eternøl is a 15mm tabletop skirmish game. This discord bot is a tool for server members to use to get quick info about unit profiles and keyword definitions. 

This was initially built using Javascript, as [BogBot](https://github.com/kyebrowning/BogBot), but was re-written and re-designed using Python and py-cord. One of the significant changes between bots is the ability to dynamically create/update commands from a spreadsheet. Currently, this is being stored locally, but I have plans to move it onto a shared server that will also populate information on the website.

To call eternøl bot, users can simply use `/` and type in either a unit name or keyword to receive their profiles or definitions. 

###### Functionality to add in future revs:
- [x] Send message to user upon joining the server (Mee6 used to do this but it's now a paid feature)
- [ ] Create subgroups to organize commands better
- [ ] Move csv files from being stored locally to the cloud
